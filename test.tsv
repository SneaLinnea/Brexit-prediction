1/1	... people who have NEVER voted... sneaky way of saying Brexit voters are dumb
0/0	Being a member of the European Union is a bit like going to a sandwich shop and buying a ¬£3 sandwich with a ¬£5 note and getting back over ¬£1,000 in change
1/1	Britain's exit is a huge blow to the dream of a united Europe  No. It is the end of an anti-national, centralized, globalist, neoliberal and authoritarian system and organism like the EU and its hegemonic power over Europe.
1/1	"Europe Union 'lost' Britain. is more accurate. Now the EU has decided they're happy for Britain to leave as long as they can keep our cash, use us as a military base for a 10-nation ""coalition of the willing"", and hand down rules forever unchallenged by any form of British input in the workings failings of the EU. Britain was a major pillar of the EU and is still a central player in Europe and the world. What bothers me more is in March 2019 Britain is set to leave and the deal worked for Britain does not serve Britain but Brussels. I can't begin to describe the bloodbath we the British public are going to inflict upon our politicians at the next General Election if they sell us short with a BRslavery. Britain will be a minor-coalition of parties and independents for the next 30 years while Britain is rebuilt. Red and Blue who played their part in this deliberate betrayal will be utterly obliterated and forever regarded as traitors.   If May can't cut it get the 42 letters in RIGHT NOW!   We will hold you to account if you don't.  We're watching..."
1/0	Great Britain has pissed their own pants. They can leave. And wont be missed!!!
0/0	I know #Brexit's a huge fucking mistake but my boss wants it, so I'm going along with it b/c I'm a spineless fucking shitbag / complete moron. And that, kiddies, is why I left the @UKLabour Party. #PeoplesVote
1/0	"I'll tell where were going, this Brexit was prophesied and will lead to a United and consolidated 10 nations of Europe. A mixture of iron and clay, (strength and weakness), Daniel 2:41-44; 11:41-44). Bible prophecy is exploding globally, cumulative, and quickly. The King is coming after much tribulation and the rise of the NWO antichrist system, the beast system, the one world government. Jesus the Messiah will end that when He returns. We live in amazing times. Be ready. We are the Matthew 24 Luke 21 Hosea 4:3 Daniel 12:4 2 Timothy 3 and 2 Peter 3 generation. We are in the days of Noah and Lot."
0/0	"I'm leaving the EU, now give me a good deal.  ""Why should we?""  ""Fuck, I hadn't thought that far ahead."""
1/1	If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, she must always choose the open sea. - Winston Chruchill
1/0	In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans have come to Britain to do a job,
1/0	It would imperil Britain‚Äôs security‚Äù
0/0	Jobs first Brexit is a lie.
1/1	Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.
0/0	"Negotiation is a misleading term. The UK has essentially forfeited it's only bargaining chip-- it's membership in the EU. Now, those trade ""negotiations"" will go like this. EU: Use the economic standards we set. UK: Or what? EU: Or you'll destroy your own economy by creating massive trade imbalances. You depend on the Euro common market for almost your trade. UK: Oh... Okay..."
0/0	No deal Brexit is dead - dead as dead gets. May's deal will be rejected. The only viable option is to remain in the EU.
1/0	So the interesting question is what happens when Britain is forced to seek ever closer ties to the US rather than Europe?
0/-1	Survivable, hardly an inspiring state of affairs. We want to thrive, not just survive.
1/1	The EU is anti-democratic and beyond reform,
0/0	This is huge for every single person and I think it's still not understood what no deal means - National Farmers' Union president explains just how disastrous a no deal Brexit would be for farmers and the food industry in the UK.
0/0	We'll keep all of the benefits of EU membership without any of the burdens or responsibilities!  Totally unrealistic‚Ä¶
1/1	What does the UK really think? It really thinks we should leave, which is what we voted for!!!
0/0/0	Why Does The UK Want To Leave The EU? we don't.
1/1	brexit is racist and xenophobic, typical NPC programmed response. Cant they use some real argument for why they support the EU instead of repeating the same damn phrase over and over again?
1/0	making an example of the UK, scaring the other members do they don't leave. Sounds like a great club
1/1	making an example of the UK, scaring the other members do they don't leave. Sounds like a great club üëåüèª
1/1	the Prime Minsiter has said she is still intent on securing a deal of some sort Translation: PM May still thinks there is a way to deny Brexit to the people.
1/1	#AngelaMerkel IS A DISGUSTING #HUMAN BEING! SHAME ON YOU! #DavidCameron #BBC #SKY #ITV #EU #UK #Euref #VoteLeave #RT
1/1	#Brexit I will do everything possible to ensure stopping Brexit is not allowed to happen and am confident we can defeat this motion.
